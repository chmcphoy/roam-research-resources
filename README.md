## Why Roam?

* [Twitter thread by @Conaw on Roam Research, knowledge, notes etc.](https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1198399750032232449)

## Roam Usage Inspiration

**Note:** _While these tutorials are helpful, don't get bogged down. Once you get the basics - start
writing, and you'll discover patterns and structures that work uniquely well for you. Roam is
great in that you can put stuff into it and it just works. No need to over
consume "best practices."_
